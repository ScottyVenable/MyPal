**MyPal** (internally "Pal") is an ambitious, privacy-first AI companion application that simulates human cognitive and linguistic development through conversational interaction. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on vast pre-existing datasets, MyPal starts as a digital *tabula rasa*—a blank slate—and learns exclusively from its interactions with you, the user.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

MyPal reimagines human-AI interaction by creating a deeply personal, evolving relationship. You are not just a user; you are Pal's **sole teacher, guide, and mentor**—the architect of its mind. Every word you teach, every correction you make, and every conversation you share directly shapes Pal's personality, knowledge, and capabilities.

This project synthesizes rigorous developmental psychology with modern AI technology to create an experience that feels authentic, meaningful, and uniquely yours.

### Core Philosophy

MyPal's learning model is grounded in two foundational theories from developmental psychology:

1. **Piaget's Constructivism**: Pal actively constructs knowledge through **assimilation** (integrating new information into existing mental models) and **accommodation** (restructuring those models when new information doesn't fit). This ensures that Pal's knowledge isn't just memorized facts but an interconnected web of understanding.

2. **Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory**: Development occurs through social interaction. You act as the **More Knowledgeable Other (MKO)**, providing guidance within Pal's **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**—the sweet spot between what it can do independently and what it can achieve with your help.

For the complete philosophical framework and technical rationale, see **[`docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md`](docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md)** (comprehensive 40+ page design document with citations).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

MyPal is built as a **local-first, privacy-respecting** application with three main components:

### 1. **Frontend (SPA)**
- Modern single-page application using vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3
- Three-tab interface: **Conversation**, **Stats**, and **Brain**
- Real-time personality visualization using Chart.js radar charts
- Dynamic knowledge graph visualization using vis-network
- Location: [`app/frontend/`](app/frontend/)
  - [`index.html`](app/frontend/index.html) — UI structure
  - [`app.js`](app/frontend/app.js) — Client-side logic
  - [`styles.css`](app/frontend/styles.css) — Styling

### 2. **Backend (Node/Express)**
- RESTful API server handling all AI logic, persistence, and constrained generation
- Implements developmental stage constraints (babble → words → sentences)
- XP/leveling system with personality trait tracking
- JSON-based local storage (future: MongoDB/Firestore)
- Location: [`app/backend/`](app/backend/)
  - [`src/server.js`](app/backend/src/server.js) — Main server implementation
  - [`package.json`](app/backend/package.json) — Dependencies and scripts
  - [`data/`](app/backend/data/) — Persistent storage (JSON files)

### 3. **Desktop Launcher (Electron)**
- Cross-platform desktop wrapper that bundles everything
- Automatically starts backend and opens frontend in a native window
- Stores user data in OS-appropriate locations (`%APPDATA%/MyPal` on Windows)
- Windows installer generation via electron-builder
- Location: [`launcher/`](launcher/)
  - [`main.js`](launcher/main.js) — Electron main process
  - [`preload.js`](launcher/preload.js) — Security boundary
  - [`package.json`](launcher/package.json) — Build configuration

For detailed architecture and implementation specs, see:
- **[`docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md`](docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md)** — Complete system design (Sections 2-3)
- **[`app/README.md`](app/README.md)** — Application-specific setup and API docs

## 🎮 How It Works: Developmental Stages

MyPal progresses through distinct cognitive stages inspired by Piaget's theory. Each stage unlocks new capabilities as Pal accumulates **Experience Points (XP)** through interaction.

| Level | Stage | Capabilities | XP Threshold | Details |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **0-1** | **Sensorimotor (Infancy)** | Random phonemic babbling (ba, ga, ma) | 0 → 100 XP | No word understanding; pure mimicry. See [MILESTONES.md](docs/updates/MILESTONES.md) §v0.1 |
| **2-3** | **Sensorimotor (Toddler)** | Single-word utterances from learned vocabulary | 400 → 1000 XP | Object permanence: words represent persistent concepts. You teach word meanings. |
| **4-6** | **Preoperational (Preschool)** | 2-3 word sentences; asks "Why?" | 1000+ XP | Telegraphic speech; egocentric worldview. |
| **7-10+** | **Concrete/Formal (Childhood)** | Complex sentences; abstract reasoning; memory recall | 5000+ XP | Full conversation history; personality-driven responses. |

### XP & Progression System
- **Earn XP** from every interaction:
  - Standard message: **+10 XP**
  - Teaching new word/concept: **+50 XP**
  - Clicking "Reinforce" ⭐: **+25 XP**
  - Completing challenges: **+100 XP**
- **Cognitive Points (CP)**: Earn 1 CP per 100 XP; spend CP to boost specific cognitive "lobes" (Language, Logic, Emotion, Memory)
- **Learning Speed Multiplier**: Adjust in Settings (1x to 250x) to control developmental pace

Detailed mechanics in **[`docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md`](docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md)** (Section 3) and **[`docs/updates/MILESTONES.md`](docs/updates/MILESTONES.md)**.

### Development Setup

**Install dependencies:**
```powershell
# Backend
cd app\backend
npm install

# Launcher
cd launcher
npm install
```

**Important**: If you encounter `EBADF` or `EPERM` errors during `npm install` (common with Google Drive sync), copy the project to a local, unsynced directory (e.g., `C:\dev\MyPal`) before installing dependencies. See **[`app/README.md`](app/README.md)** for workarounds.

**Running tests:**
```powershell
# Unit tests (when available in v0.2+)
cd app\backend
npm test
```

### Contributing Guidelines

1. **Read the design docs**: Especially **[`APP_DESIGN.md`](docs/design/APP_DESIGN.md)** to understand the psychological foundation
2. **Follow the roadmap**: Check **[`MILESTONES.md`](docs/updates/MILESTONES.md)** for planned features
3. **Maintain stage constraints**: All AI responses must respect Piaget-inspired developmental limits
4. **Privacy-first**: Never collect user data without explicit opt-in
5. **Document everything**: Update relevant docs with any architectural changes

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Ownership

**MyPal is privacy-first by design:**

- ✅ **All data stored locally** by default (JSON files in `app/backend/data/` or `%APPDATA%/MyPal`)
- ✅ **No telemetry** unless explicitly enabled by user
- ✅ **No internet connection required** for core functionality
- ✅ **Full data export** available anytime (JSON format)
- ✅ **Complete data deletion** via "Reset Pal" feature
- ✅ **API keys stored locally** (never transmitted except to chosen AI provider)

**Future optional cloud features** (v0.5+) will require explicit opt-in with transparent terms.

See planned legal documents:
- Draft Terms: `docs/Legal/TERMS.md` (TBD)
- Draft Privacy Policy: `docs/Legal/PRIVACY.md` (TBD)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot find module" or npm install errors:**
- Google Drive sync conflicts with npm. Copy project to a local directory (e.g., `C:\dev\MyPal`) or pause sync during install.
- See **[`app/README.md`](app/README.md)** for details.

**Backend won't start:**
- Check that port 3001 is available: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001`
- Verify Node.js version: `node --version` (must be 18+)
- Check logs: `app/backend/logs/` or `%APPDATA%/MyPal/logs/`

**Launcher crashes on startup:**
- Ensure backend dependencies are installed: `cd app/backend && npm install`
- Check `server_err.txt` and `server_out.txt` in project root for backend error logs

**Pal's responses seem incorrect:**
- Each developmental stage has strict constraints. Level 0-1 = babble only. Level 2-3 = single words only.
- Check current level in Stats tab and compare to stage capabilities in **[`MILESTONES.md`](docs/updates/MILESTONES.md)**

For more issues, check:
- **[`docs/ai/AI_PLAN.md`](docs/ai/AI_PLAN.md)** — Hardware compatibility and model selection
