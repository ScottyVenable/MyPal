# Quick TODO
Just a few notes to keep track of tasks and ideas, quick todo notes. 
**DO NOT DELETE**

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Completed (Oct 24, 2025)
- âœ… **Fixed npm command invocation** - AUTORUN.ps1 now properly calls npm commands
- âœ… **Migrated Tauri config to v2** - Updated tauri.conf.json to Tauri 2.0 format
- âœ… **Tests passing** - Backend tests run successfully (2/2 passing)

## ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

1. Remove empty log folders when starting autorun.ps1
2. Make an EXE file for autorun (called MyPal.exe) that just opens a cmd window to run the autorun.ps1 file?
3. Test Tauri app launch after configuration fixes
4. Update documentation with recent changes
