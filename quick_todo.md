# Quick TODO
Just a few notes to keep track of tasks and ideas, quick todo notes. 
**DO NOT DELETE**

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Completed (Oct 24, 2025)
- âœ… **Fixed npm command invocation** - AUTORUN.ps1 now properly calls npm commands
- âœ… **Migrated Tauri config to v2** - Updated tauri.conf.json to Tauri 2.0 format
- âœ… **Tests passing** - Backend tests run successfully (2/2 passing)

## ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

1. Remove empty log folders when starting autorun.ps1
2. Make an EXE file for autorun (called MyPal.exe) that just opens a cmd window to run the autorun.ps1 file?
3. Test Tauri app launch after configuration fixes
4. Update documentation with recent changes
5. Remove the cmd window that pops up, since it should be a dev console for Tauri when opening in dev mode.
6. Resolve the merging conflicts from `Add comprehensive test suite for MyPal backend and frontend (237+ tests) #14` pull and then merge it with mypal-v0.3-alpha when merging conflicts are completed.
7. Create a branch for `mypal-release`, `mypal-alpha`. Then merge `mypal-v0.3-alpha` into `mypal-alpha` and create a new branch to work on called `mypal-alpha-v0.4`.
