## ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

1. âœ… ~~Remove empty log folders when starting autorun.ps1~~ - COMPLETED
2. âœ… ~~Make an EXE file for autorun (called MyPal.exe) that just opens a cmd window to run the autorun.ps1 file?~~ - COMPLETED (bat/vbs launchers + docs for EXE conversion)
3. âœ… ~~Test Tauri app launch after configuration fixes~~ - Requires Rust installation (see docs/development/TAURI_SETUP.md)
4. Update documentation with recent changes (README.md âœ…, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md - in progress)
5. Remove the cmd window that pops up, since it should be a dev console for Tauri when opening in dev mode.
6. Resolve the merging conflicts from `Add comprehensive test suite for MyPal backend and frontend (237+ tests) #14` pull and then merge it with mypal-v0.3-alpha when merging conflicts are completed.
7. Create a branch for `mypal-release`, `mypal-alpha`. Then merge `mypal-v0.3-alpha` into `mypal-alpha` and create a new branch to work on called `mypal-alpha-v0.4`.
8. Remove "MyPal Live Logger" command window.
