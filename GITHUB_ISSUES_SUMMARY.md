### 2. scripts/create-github-issues.sh

**Features:**
- Creates 23 high-priority issues automatically
- Includes proper labels and categorization
- Adds detailed descriptions with markdown formatting
- Shows progress and summary

### 3. scripts/README.md
Documentation for the scripts directory explaining how to use the issue creation script.

## How to Create the Issues

Since the automated agent environment cannot directly create GitHub issues (authentication/permission limitation), you need to run the script manually:

### Prerequisites
1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Ensure you have write access to the repository

### Execute the Script

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /path/to/MyPal

# Run the script
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Verify GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
2. ‚úÖ Ask for confirmation before creating issues
3. ‚úÖ Create 23 high-priority issues with proper labels
4. ‚úÖ Display a summary of created issues

### Alternative: Manual Creation

If you prefer to review each issue before creating, refer to `ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md` and create them manually through the GitHub web interface.

## Issue Priorities

### Immediate Action Required (P0 - Critical)
1. **BUG-001**: Pal returns question instead of answering at Level 2
2. **BUG-002**: New Pal name textbox uneditable after returning to main menu

### High Priority (P1)
3. **BUG-003**: Race condition when multiple chats arrive
4. **BUG-004**: Duplicate keyword echoing in journal
5. **BUG-005**: Telemetry write failures on Windows
6. **BUG-006**: Neuron view not closing
7. **BUG-007**: Pop-out chat modal drag jump
8. **INFRA-002**: Electron builder configuration fix

### Next Sprint
- Test new learning systems (FEAT-001)
- Developer debug mode (FEAT-002)
- Enhanced help system (FEAT-003)
- UI style consistency (FEAT-005)

## Statistics

## Next Steps

After creating the issues:

1. **Review and Organize**
   - Verify all issues were created successfully
   - Add milestones for sprint planning
   - Create a project board to track progress

2. **Prioritize**
   - Address P0 critical bugs immediately
   - Plan P1 issues for current sprint
   - Backlog P2/P3 issues for future sprints

3. **Assign**
   - Assign team members based on expertise
   - Add estimates to project fields
   - Link related issues

4. **Update TODO Files**
   - Once issues are created, consider deprecating TODO files
   - Reference GitHub issues instead of inline TODOs
   - Maintain ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md as historical reference

## Notes

- The script is designed to be idempotent (GitHub prevents exact duplicates)
- Issues include emoji prefixes for easy visual identification
- All issues reference original TODO line numbers for traceability
- Labels are consistent with GitHub best practices
- Issue templates follow standard markdown formatting

## Validation

To verify the script works without creating issues:
```bash
# Syntax check (already validated)
bash -n scripts/create-github-issues.sh

# Dry run (would need gh authentication)
# The script will ask for confirmation before creating
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the script:
1. Ensure GitHub CLI is properly installed and authenticated
2. Check you have write permissions to the repository
3. Verify the repository URL matches your GitHub account
4. Review `scripts/README.md` for troubleshooting tips
