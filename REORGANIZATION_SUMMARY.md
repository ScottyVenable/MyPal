# Project Reorganization Summary

**Date**: October 20, 2025

## What Changed

The MyPal project structure has been reorganized to separate **public files** (for GitHub) from **private development files** (local only).

### Before (Old Structure)
```
MyPal/
├── app/
│   ├── backend/
│   └── frontend/
├── dev/
│   ├── docs/          # Mixed public/private
│   ├── src/bin/launcher/  # Public but buried
│   ├── builds/        # Private
│   ├── config/        # Private
│   └── tests/         # Private
└── logs/
```

### After (New Structure)
```
MyPal/
├── app/               # Public - Application runtime
│   ├── backend/
│   └── frontend/
├── launcher/          # Public - Desktop launcher (moved from dev/src/bin/launcher/)
├── docs/              # Public - Documentation (moved from dev/docs/)
│   ├── design/
│   ├── ai/
│   └── updates/
├── dev/               # Private - Now in .gitignore
│   ├── builds/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── docs/notes/    # Private dev notes remain
└── logs/
```

## Key Changes

### 1. **Launcher Moved to Root**
- **Old**: `dev/src/bin/launcher/`
- **New**: `launcher/`
- **Reason**: The launcher is a core public component that users need to build the desktop app

### 2. **Documentation Moved to Root**
- **Old**: `dev/docs/design/`, `dev/docs/ai/`, `dev/docs/updates/`
- **New**: `docs/design/`, `docs/ai/`, `docs/updates/`
- **Reason**: Design documents and plans have educational value and should be public

### 3. **Dev Folder Now Private**
- Added `dev/` to `.gitignore`
- Contains build artifacts, private configs, test files, and personal notes
- Won't be pushed to GitHub

## Files Updated

All path references were updated in:
- ✅ `README.md` - Main project README
- ✅ `app/README.md` - Application-specific docs
- ✅ `launcher/README.md` - Launcher documentation
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Added `dev/` exclusion

## What to Push to GitHub

**Public (Include in Git):**
- `app/` - Application code
- `launcher/` - Desktop launcher
- `docs/` - Public documentation
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `.gitignore` - Git configuration

**Private (Excluded from Git):**
- `dev/` - Development files, builds, private notes
- `logs/` - Runtime logs
- `app/backend/data/*.json` - User data files
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (per .gitignore)

## Migration Checklist

If you have an existing clone:
1. ✅ Pull latest changes
2. ✅ Note: `docs/` and `launcher/` are now at project root
3. ✅ Your local `dev/` folder won't be tracked (it's in .gitignore now)
4. ✅ Update any local scripts/shortcuts to use new paths

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Repository**: Only relevant files visible on GitHub
2. **Better Organization**: Public vs private clearly separated
3. **Easier Navigation**: Important files (launcher, docs) at top level
4. **Privacy**: Development artifacts and notes stay local
5. **Professional**: GitHub repo shows polished, production-ready structure

## Next Steps

When you're ready to push to GitHub:
```powershell
cd <project-root>
git add .
git commit -m "Reorganize project structure: move launcher and docs to root, privatize dev folder"
git push
```

Your `dev/` folder will remain on your local machine but won't be pushed to GitHub.
