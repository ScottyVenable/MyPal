# MyPal Dev Workspace

This is the development workspace root. Key directories:

- `docs/` — project documentation for developers (designs, notes, AI plan, etc.)
- `src/` — application source tree for development parity with releases
- `config/` — development/test configuration files
- `tests/` — automated tests/harnesses
- `assets/` — images, icons, media used in app and docs
- `builds/` — output packages by OS (`windows`, `linux`, `macos`) with `dev` and `release` subfolders

See `dev/docs/notes/folder structure.md` for the canonical structure description.
