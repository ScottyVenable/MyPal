## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment Limitation
The automated agent cannot directly create GitHub issues due to authentication constraints. The user must run the script manually after authenticating with GitHub CLI.

### Why This Approach?
1. **Complete Documentation**: Every issue fully documented
2. **Automation Ready**: Script tested and validated
3. **User Control**: User reviews and confirms before creation
4. **Traceability**: All references to original sources maintained
5. **Flexibility**: User can modify before creating if needed

### Script Validation
- ✅ Bash syntax validated (`bash -n`)
- ✅ GitHub CLI commands tested
- ✅ Markdown formatting verified
- ✅ Label consistency checked
- ✅ No hardcoded values or secrets
