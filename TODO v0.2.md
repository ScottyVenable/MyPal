# MyPal v0.2 TODO List

## 🐛 BUGS & CRITICAL ISSUES
### P0 - Production Breaking
- [ ] [BUG-001] Pal returns question instead of answering at Level 2
    - **Environment:** MyPal app (Level 2 cognitive setting)
    - **Severity:** Critical
    - **Steps to reproduce:**
        1. Launch MyPal and select/configure a Pal at Level 2
        2. Ask a direct factual question (e.g., "What is the capital of France?")
        3. Observe Pal replies with question instead of answer
    - **Expected:** Level 2 should return concise, direct answers
    - **Actual:** Pal deflects with questions (e.g., "Why do you want to know?")
    - **Impact:** Users don't receive expected information; degrades conversational utility
    - **Suspected causes:** Curiosity thresholds too aggressive for Level 2, intent classification issues
    - **Due:** ASAP

- [ ] [BUG-002] New Pal name textbox uneditable after returning to main menu
    - **Environment:** MyPal UI (New Pal dialog)
    - **Severity:** High - prevents creating new Pal
    - **Steps to reproduce:**
        1. Launch MyPal
        2. Press "Exit" to return to Main Menu
        3. Click "New Pal" to open dialog
        4. Attempt to type in Name textbox
    - **Expected:** Name textbox autofocuses and accepts typing
    - **Actual:** No caret appears; keyboard input ignored
    - **Impact:** Cannot create new Pals
    - **Suspected causes:** Missing autofocus logic, disabled/readonly attributes, focus trap issues
    - **Due:** Current Sprint
