## Menus
This section describes the design ideas for the various menus within the MyPal application.

### Brain Menu

#### Neural Activity Visualization

A dynamic, real-time visualization of neural activity that provides users with insights into their AI companion's thought processes. Neurons will light up and connect as the AI processes information, creating an engaging and educational experience. The more active the AI, the more vibrant and complex the visualization becomes.

Neurons are represented as glowing nodes, with connections illustrated as animated lines. The color intensity and animation speed reflect the level of activity, allowing users to intuitively grasp their AI's cognitive state. See the design of the brain graph canvas.

#### Recent Memories
A scrollable list of recent memories, each represented by a card that includes a brief description, timestamp, and associated tags. Users can click on a memory card to replace the brain visualization with detailed information about that memory, including its context and significance. The user can then view more details, edit tags, or delete the memory. The design emphasizes clarity and ease of navigation, with a focus on helping users quickly find and manage their AI's memories. When a memory is in focus, the user has the option to "Return to Language Development" to go back to the main brain visualization.
