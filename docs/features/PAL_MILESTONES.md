# PAL Milestones Feature Documentation

## Overview
PAL Milestones is a gamified achievement system that tracks and celebrates your AI companion's cognitive, social, and emotional development through unlockable achievements. Similar to developmental milestones in child psychology, these achievements represent meaningful progress markers that make the AI companion feel more alive and foster emotional connection.

## Core Concept
The Milestones system transforms abstract AI development into tangible, memorable moments. Each milestone represents a significant achievement in the PAL's growth journey, from first interactions to complex cognitive abilities, creating a narrative of shared experiences between user and AI companion.
