# Error Fixes Summary (PATCH-v0.1.1)

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Variable Name Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Mixed usage of `neuralData` and `neuralState` variables causing undefined errors
**Fix**: 
- Standardized all neural network functions to use `neuralState`
- Updated `updateNeuralStats()` and `updateNeuralEvents()` functions
- Removed duplicate `neuralData` variable declaration

### 2. ✅ Incorrect API Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to fetch from `/neural-network` but server endpoint is `/neural`
**Fix**: 
- Updated `fetchNeuralNetwork()` function to use correct endpoint
- Changed to use `apiFetch()` helper for proper error handling
- Fixed data extraction from response

### 3. ✅ Content Security Policy Violations
**Problem**: Inline `onclick` handlers in dynamically generated HTML causing CSP violations
**Fix**:
- Removed inline `onclick="..."` from neuron modal HTML
- Removed inline `onclick="..."` from region details HTML
- Added proper event listeners using `addEventListener()`

### 4. ✅ Missing Neural Growth Collections
**Problem**: One instance of `addXp()` not passing collections parameter for neural growth
**Fix**:
- Updated sentiment feedback reward system to pass collections
- Ensures neural growth triggers properly on all XP gains

### 5. ✅ Backend Connection Issues
**Problem**: Backend server wasn't running, causing connection refused errors
**Fix**:
- Successfully started backend server on localhost:3001
- Multi-profile migration completed successfully
- Neural network initialized with 265 neurons

## Remaining Potential Issues

### Backend Stability
- Server occasionally shuts down with "Graceful shutdown triggered by SIGINT"
- This might be due to terminal focus changes or other system signals
- Solution: Use a proper process manager like PM2 for production

### WebSocket Connection
- Neural WebSocket should connect automatically when backend is running
- Real-time neural visualization should work once both frontend and backend are active

## Testing Status

### ✅ Backend
- Server starts successfully on port 3001
- Profile system working (migration completed)
- Neural network initialized properly
- API endpoints should be accessible

### ⏳ Frontend  
- Need to test in browser with backend running
- Neural visualization should load properly now
- Manual triggering system should work with proper CP deduction

## Next Steps

1. **Start both services**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd app/backend
   node src/server.js
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend (or open in browser)
   cd app/frontend
   # Open index.html in browser
   ```

2. **Test neural visualization**:
   - Navigate to Brain tab → Neural Activity
   - Check if neural regions render properly
   - Try manual neuron triggering

3. **Monitor console**:
   - Should see no more connection refused errors
   - Neural events should stream via WebSocket
   - CSP violations should be resolved

## Code Quality Improvements Made

- **Better Error Handling**: Using `apiFetch()` consistently
- **Proper Event Handling**: Removed inline handlers for better security
- **Data Consistency**: Unified variable naming across functions
- **API Alignment**: Fixed endpoint mismatches between frontend/backend

The main errors from the browser console should now be resolved with the backend running and these code fixes in place.
