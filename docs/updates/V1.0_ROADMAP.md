# Version 1.0 Roadmap

This roadmap distills the plan across milestones to reach a stable 1.0 for the game-like AI companion.

## Vision
- A local-first, privacy-respecting companion that grows with the player, with optional on-device LLM and opt-in cloud features.

## Milestones

- v0.1 — Infancy (MVP)
  - Local-only backend + SPA frontend
  - JSON persistence; Stage 0–1 constraints
  - Stats tab (level/xp/cp/personality), basic Brain view placeholder
  - Health check + minimal logging, developer tools

- v0.2 — Toddler
  - Vocabulary teaching loops and validations
  - Single-word constraint from learned vocabulary
  - Local model adapter scaffold (stub with interface)

- v0.3 — Preschool
  - Telegraphic speech (2–3 word utterances)
  - Streaming responses and cancel
  - Minimal “Brain” graph visualization of concepts and links

- v0.4 — Childhood
  - Memory summaries; basic preference extraction
  - Sentiment score drives personality axes
  - Export/import improvements (migrations)

- v0.5 — Cloud Memory (Opt-in)
  - Auth (local accounts) and optional cloud sync of settings/history
  - Storage abstraction (JSON → SQLite → remote)
  - Website docs + release channel

- v0.6–0.9 — Polish & Extensibility
  - On-device LLM integration (quantized models) with auto-selection via hardware specs
  - Plugin system (server hooks + basic UI)
  - CP boosts, avatar evolution, UI/UX refinements

- v1.0 — Stable
  - Cross-platform installers (Win/macOS/Linux)
  - Robust local model runtime (fallback to cloud only if chosen)
  - Completed Brain visualization; telemetry opt-in; comprehensive docs and support

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Safety: persona guardrails by stage; content reporting pipeline
- Privacy: local-first defaults; clear opt-ins; key management
- Performance: bounded context, streaming, model selection heuristics
- DX: logs, dev panel, CI builds, reproducible dev setup
